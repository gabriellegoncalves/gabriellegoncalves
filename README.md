Hi there!!! 
my name is Gabrielle, but you can call me Gabi. This is very strange, anyways. I'm gonna talk about me:

- ğŸ”­ I'm a tall girl (very tall)
- ğŸŒ± I can play many instruments, I can cook, I play voleyball, and I go to the gym (sometimes) 
- ğŸ‘¯ I have a big and strange family, two sibilins and my parents, and now that my sister is married, I got a niece
- ğŸ’¬ My favorite thing in the world is God (hallelujah) and spand time with my friends
- ğŸ“« I have curly and short hair
- ğŸ˜„ I'm calm, sometimes. 
- âš¡ And I think I'm pretty
--> that's it.
  kisses kisses
